# Cassava Leaf Disease Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying cassava leaf diseases using state-of-the-art transformer models. The dataset comprises images of cassava leaves affected by different diseases, including bacterial blight, brown streak disease, green mottle, mosaic disease, and healthy leaves.
